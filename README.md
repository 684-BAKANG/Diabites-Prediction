# Diabetes Prediction with Python and Jupyter Notebook

This project aims to predict diabetes using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The prediction is based on a dataset containing various medical features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. We will use machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, please follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
1. Python (version 3.6 or later)
2. Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository. You can download the dataset and place it in the project directory with the name Diabetes Dataset.csv.

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal: jupyter notebook
2. Open the diabetes_prediction.ipynb notebook.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells and analyze the results.
